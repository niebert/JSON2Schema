#  Migration of [JSON2Schema to GitLab](ttps://niehausbert.gitlab.io/JSON2Schema)
This repository contains the [old JSON2Schema Tool](https://niebert.github.io/JSON2Schema).

## [JSON2Schema on GitLab](https://niehausbert.gitlab.io/JSON2Schema)
The [current version of JSON2Schema tool is now available on GitLab](https://niehausbert.gitlab.io/JSON2Schema). It generates
* JSON schema from a give JSON,
* provide an editor (ACE) to modify labels, ... in the generated JSON schema,
* you can save the generated JSON schema,
* <b style="color:red">NEW on GitLab</b> you can download a [complete JSON editor of Jeremy Dorn](https://niehausbert.gitlab.io/JSON2Schema) with the generated JSON schema. 

## JSON2Schema
JSON2Schema is a small WebApp running totally in your browser, that supports developers in creating a JSON Schema for the JSON Editor [originally developed by Jeremy Dorn](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor) and is now available and maintained as `json-editor` package in https://www.github.com/json-editor/json-editor

## Online Demo JSON2Schema
You can check the JSON2Schema tool with the following URL:

https://niebert.github.io/JSON2Schema

Copy a JSON of your choice into the JSON2Schema tool and create a raw JSON schema, that [works in the JSON editor](https://www.github.com/json-editor/json-editor)

## JSON Schema
A JSON Schema is a basically a file, that defines the layout of the input and chosen editor elements for each key-value pair in given JSON for the [JSON Editor of Jeremy Dorn](https://www.github.com/json-editor/json-editor), i.e. it defines if the user of the JSON editor:
* Edit a string,
* uses a select box for different options the graphical user interface GUI,
* select a color,
* select a data,
* increase or decrease an integer value,
* ...

## How Create a JSON Schema
Define a JSON you want to use for you application.
```json
{
  "name":"Hans Mustermann",
  "age":36,
  "weightlist": [
    {
      "date":"2018-05-23T8:37:58.258Z",
      "value":76.0
    }
  ],
  "temperaturelist": [
    {
      "date":"2018-05-24T07:22:55.332Z",
      "value":36.5
    }
  ]
}
```
As in example we create a privacy-friendly WebApp, that stores health related personal data WITHOUT sending the collected data to a server for commercial data harvesting (like fitness tracker). A patient measure temperature and weight on a daily basis. The collected data is stored in the mobile device in JSON file without connecting a server. The storage format of the JSON is defined by a JSON Schema. If you plugin the JSON Schema into the JSON Editor originally generated by Jeremy Dorn, then the JSON editor will provide the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to input the data. Creating a WebApp in general or using the JSON Editor does to specify does not imply that the collected data is not submitted from the mobile device to remote server. OpenSource architecture of the WebApp assures that the computer scientist can validate, if the source code contains hidden components that submit the collected JSON data to remote server.  For a privacy friendly WebApp for the data mentioned above could be stored (even encrypted) on the SD-card of the mobile device or in the local storage of the browser (see [AppLSAC](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/AppLSAC)).

Use the [sample JSON in the Demo JSON2Schema](https://niebert.github.io/JSON2Schema) WebApp to play around the Schema generation and edit the generate Schema to understand how the JSON Schema defines the Graphical User Interface of the JSON Editor.

* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) Developer Eli Grey provided the `FileSaver.js` that is used to store created `JSCC` files to the local filesystem. `JSCC` uses the same mechanism of browsers, that allows a `Save as...` in the context menu of a web pages or image. So not uncontrolled write access to your file system is implemented, because users have to select the locations in which the user whats to store the file (e.g. JSON, Javascript or HTML).
* [JointJS](https://github.com/clientIO/joint) JointJS is a JavaScript diagramming library. It can be used to create either static diagrams. JointJS is used in this project to create UML-diagrams, that are interactive diagramming in conjunction and application builder in Javascript.

* [3 ways to define a JavaScript class](https://www.phpied.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/) by Stoyan Stefanov
* [JQuery](https://jqueryui.com) is used for the theme and standard operations in the Document Object Model (DOM) of HTML-pages. The [JQuery-Themeroller](https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/) was used to create a JQuery theme for JSCC.
* [JSZip](http://stuartk.com/jszip) - LibreOffice files, Geogebra files (Open Source applications) have file extensions that are actually ZIP files. To handle, change and generate those documents in a browser is possible the library JSZIP. Even a small file system for WebApps that can be stored with a folder structure in a ZIP file can be generated in a browser. So [JSZip](http://stuartk.com/jszip) is a multi-functional JavaScript class for generating and reading ZIP files. Thank you for sharing this great library with the Open Source community.
