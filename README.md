# JSON2Schema
JSON2Schema is a small WebApp running totally in your browser, that supports developers in creating a JSON Schema for the JSON Editor originally developed by Jeremy Dorn and available as  package in https://www.github.com/json-editor/json-editor

## Online Demo JSON2Schema
You can check the JSON2Schema tool with the following URL:

https://niebert.github.io/JSON2Schema

Copy a JSON of your choice into the JSON2Schema tool and create a raw JSON schema, that [works in the JSON editor](https://www.github.com/json-editor/json-editor)

## JSON Schema
A JSON Schema is a basically a file, that defines the layout of the input and edit elements for the JSON Editor.
* Edit a string,
* use a select box for the graphical user interface GUI,
* select a color,
* select a data,
* ...

## How Create a JSON Schema
Define a JSON you want to use for you application.
```json
{
  "name":"Hans Mustermann",
  "age":36,
  "weightlist": [
    {
      "date":"2018-05-23T8:37:58.258Z",
      "value":76.0
    }
  ],
  "temperaturelist": [
    {
      "date":"2018-05-24T07:22:55.332Z",
      "value":36.5
    }
  ]
}
```
As in example we create a privacy-friendly WebApp, that stores health related personal data WITHOUT sending the collected data to a server for commercial data harvesting (like fitness tracker). A patient measure temperature and weight on a daily basis. The collected data is stored in the mobile device in JSON file without connecting a server. The storage format of the JSON is defined by a JSON Schema. If you plugin the JSON Schema into the JSON Editor originally generated by Jeremy Dorn, then the JSON editor will provide the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to input the data. Creating a WebApp in general or using the JSON Editor does to specify does not imply that the collected data is not submitted from the mobile device to remote server. OpenSource architecture of the WebApp assures that the computer scientist can validate, if the source code contains hidden components that submit the collected JSON data to remote server.  For a privacy friendly WebApp for the data mentioned above could be stored (even encrypted) on the SD-card of the mobile device or in the local storage of the browser (see [AppLSAC](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/AppLSAC)).

Use the [sample JSON in the Demo JSON2Schema](https://niebert.github.io/JSON2Schema) WebApp to play around the Schema generation and edit the generate Schema to understand how the JSON Schema defines the Graphical User Interface of the JSON Editor.
